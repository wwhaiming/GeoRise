# GeoRise v2 — Win Plan & Progress Tracker

Branch: `georise-v2-footprint-privacy`. Goal: push every CODEABLE rubric gap to its honest
maximum and re-grade with the council at each checkpoint. Status legend: ☐ todo · ◐ in-progress · ☑ done+verified.

## Honest ceiling (no cheating)
A maximally harsh judge's 100/100 needs real-world validation we cannot fabricate without lying:
a real classroom pilot, real school operational data (kWh/therms/bus-miles/meals), human-labeled
eval sets, and deployment under load. Those stay explicitly UNFAKED. Every estimate ships with a
truthful confidence label + assumptions. We build the rest to masterful quality.

## Phases (dependency-ordered)

### Phase 1 — School hidden-footprint intelligence  (#1 gap, both reviews)
- ☑ `backend/utils/footprintModel.js`: Scope-style categories (electricity, natural_gas, commuting,
  cafeteria_food, landfill_waste, water) → kgCO2e/month from cited EPA/OWID factors, each with
  confidence + assumptions + low/high. Defaults labeled estimates; confidence rises with real inputs. (f79bdbd, sanity-checked)
- ☑ `backend/routes/coach.js` `/school-footprint` (baseline) + `/school-insight` (biggest emitter +
  action-leverage + grounded recommendation gated by deterministicFaithfulness >= SIM_FLOOR). (1332251, verified live)
- ☑ "action leverage" line in /school-insight, surfaced in the digest UI.
- ☑ `components/SchoolFootprint.jsx` digest as the AI-tab hero + baseline wizard. (a0c7e66, verified live + screenshotted)
- ☑ add a footprintModel unit test to backend/test (1164aed, 8 hermetic cases).

### RESUME POINTER (for a fresh session)
Branch `georise-v2-footprint-privacy`. DONE: Phase 1 (footprint intelligence + unit tests) AND
Phase 2 (privacy/FERPA-COPPA, re-scoped to additive — see docs/PRIVACY.md). Backend 79/79 green,
frontend builds clean. Committed dd85755 and pushed to georise-v2-footprint-privacy.
NEXT = council re-grade checkpoint CP1 (re-run /claude-council:ask with Phase 1+2 implemented),
then Phase 3 (evaluation rigor: real metrics, semantic entailment gate, in-app AI report card,
model cards). Phases 4-6 (winning-plan UX fixes, scale honesty, submission artifacts) after.

### Phase 2 — Privacy / FERPA-COPPA for minors  (can DISQUALIFY; non-negotiable)
RE-SCOPED (2026-06-18): code review showed the leaderboard ALREADY is the tenant boundary
(membership-gated everywhere; email never leaked). A parallel `school_id` on every table was
rejected as redundant, high-risk churn. We hardened + tested the existing boundary and spent
the budget on the additive pieces a harsh judge actually grades. Full design: docs/PRIVACY.md.
- ☑ tenant isolation hardened + proven (cross-board denial test); `school_id` migration
  intentionally NOT done (documented rationale, not an oversight).
- ☑ consent model (demo / classroom / parent); uploads blocked until consent — enforced BEFORE
  any AI call in posts + trashspotter; organizer auto-consented; student self-attest path.
- ☑ image retention (minimize default / standard / 24h / do_not_store); jimp thumbnails; full
  original never stored by default; 24h purge sweep on boot + 60s interval.
- ☑ teacher review before feed/leaderboard publication; reject reverses points EXACTLY (clawback
  by point_events.source_id). Review OFF by default; documented pending-window tradeoff.
- ☑ account export + delete (cascade, clears session); privacy-by-design + model/data card; audit log.
- ☑ backend tests: test/privacy.test.js (8 integration cases) — full suite 79/79 green.
- ☑ frontend: PrivacyCenter screen + consent gate in upload modal + Profile entry; vite build green.

### Phase 3 — Evaluation rigor (real, not illustrative)
- ◐ human-labeled eval set + Recall@k/MRR/Precision@k computed (evalMetrics.retrievalMetrics,
  surfaced in the report card). HONEST GAP: only 4 labeled retrieval cases on the curated coach
  corpus (+9 coach prompts), NOT yet >=30; refusal precision + fraud FPR still TODO.
- ☑ semantic entailment grounding gate — deterministic numeric claim-verification layer added
  ALONGSIDE the lexical coverage gate (rejects fabricated figures). Honest: heuristic proxy, not a
  learned NLI; an LLM entailment judge remains a future upgrade.
- ☑ in-app "AI report card" reads REAL eval output, not hardcoded numbers — GET
  /api/coach/eval-report serves results.json (written by `npm run test:coach-eval`),
  surfaced in the Research tab. (80/80 suite, +1 endpoint test.)
- ☑ model cards: litter CNN (real val_acc 0.936 + dataset 3527 imgs from model/trash_detector.json)
  + OpenAI vision/embeddings usage + limits — served at /api/privacy/policy, rendered in Privacy Center.
  (confusion matrix not in the model metadata file; not fabricated.)

### Phase 4 — Winning-plan correctness + UX (from the 17-agent review)
- ◐ Audited 2026-06-18. DONE this pass: gitignore the scratch dumps (3.9M txt + corpus json/html);
  backend/.env.example; OpenAI per-request timeout + retries (covers every call); deleted the dead
  chatEcoAction/simulateMockChat/CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT chain; removed the rubric-gaming chips from Coach.
  CONFIRMED already done (grep-audited): AI rate-limit/day, eco offline mock fallback, honest labels,
  auto-loaded research, Board->Home nav, GeoRise branding.
  STILL TODO: client-side image downscale (server retention already downscales storage); startup
  retrieval self-check; 502->visible refusal card; a11y dialog (role/aria-modal/focus-trap) + aria-live
  on the quiz; data-not-instructions clauses audit; carbon-formula line in the Evidence Panel;
  role-specific landing.

### Phase 5 — Scale honesty
- ☐ real vector index (sqlite-vec/pgvector) OR explicitly document brute-force as a demo choice with
  a migration path; per-school/role/endpoint quotas + cost note; disaster-mode handling + smoke load test.

### Phase 6 — Submission
- ☐ mermaid architecture; DEMO_SCRIPT (digest-first order); comparison table; one sticky hook;
  hero screenshots/GIF; deployed URL; recorded fallback video.

## Council re-grade checkpoints
- CP1 after Phase 1+2 · CP2 after Phase 3 · CP3 after Phase 4-6. Re-run `/claude-council:ask` each time,
  record the new score + remaining gaps below.

### Grade log
- Baseline (all-fixes-assumed): 85/100. Biggest blocker: validated school-level footprint intelligence.
- Phase 1 shipped: footprint model + /school-insight digest + 8 unit tests (closes the #1 codeable gap).
- Phase 2 shipped: privacy engine (consent gate, retention minimization, teacher review, export/delete,
  audit log, model card) + 8 integration tests. Addresses the FERPA/COPPA "can-disqualify" gap.
- Phase 3 (slice): in-app AI report card from real eval output.
- CP1 (2026-06-18, codex/gpt-5.5, Phase 1+2+3 real): 87/100 (was 85). Per-dim: ProblemFit 91/A-,
  AIDepth 87/B+, UX 80/B, ResponsibleAI 94/A (standout), Execution 89/A-, Presentation/Demo 72/C+
  (score sink), Originality 88/A-. #1 blocker: polished end-to-end evidence-backed demo w/ a real
  school scenario (deployed URL + video + demo script + arch diagram + comparison table). Council's
  top-3 AI fixes == remaining Phase 3 items (labeled retrieval Recall@k/MRR, semantic entailment gate,
  in-app model cards). Next: finish Phase 3, then Phase 4.
